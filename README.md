## Installation

The user needs to clone the repository to their local machine, navigate to the project directory, and install the dependencies.

## Usage

The user would run the application and be presented with the options to view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role. Any option dealing with view will output a table with what was selected. Any option dealing with add will allow the user to add what was selected to a database. The update an employee role allows the user to update an employee's role if it was entered incorrectly or if they simply needed an update.
